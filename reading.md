##  Reading for Lab 1

There is a variety of ways to setup a web development environment. You are welcomed to use your own familiar setup if you have any.

### Code Editor

For editing the code, we will use **[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, which is [one of the most popular code editors](https://designrevision.com/best-code-editor/); other popular text editors include [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

[[Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)]

### Code Management & Submission

For source code management as well as lab submissions, we will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) for a code hosting service. VS Code comes with a Git integration as well as a terminal shell integration, so you can do everything within VS Code.

[[Install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)]

You may also want to set up your Github account's [default identity](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-username-in-git). For instance, open a terminal shell in VS Code (Terminal -> New Terminal) and type the following commands with your own email and name.

```
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Please take a look at the beginning portion of how to use Git in VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol) before the section "Branches and Tags" (we are not going to use branches in our class).

### Running & Testing 

For running a web page as well as for grading, we will use Google Chrome. It provides nice development tools for debugging your code and support latest web standards.

[[Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)]

In order to run your web page (even in your local machine), you need a web server. The purpose of the web server is to transfer web page content securely to a client machine. For instance, without the server, browsers will not be able to load a data file and thus cannot present the file's content to a client. Even if you are accessing your local files for a development purpose ([More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)), the browser would not allow it. 

We will use a VS Code plugin called Live Server to set up a local development server. 

[[Download Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)]

Whenever you open a html file in VSCode, you will now see "Go Live" button as below.

### Optional

We will be working through the book *D3 - Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (Second Edition) by Scott Murray.
The book provides a lot of sample code (see [Using Sample Code](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781491921296/ch01.html#introduction)). 

- Download the sample code for the book [here](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/releases). 
- Set up a directory on your computer for the sample code and remember its location. 
- Starting next week, while working through the book, you should experiment with the sample code to prepare for labs!
